# Triage

Triage a personal inbox of documents by renaming them following the scheme:

```
<title>-<issuer>-<recipient>-<date>
```

Where:

- `<title>` is the title of the document
- `<issuer>` is the name of the issuer
- `<recipient>` is the name of the recipient
- `<date>` is the date of the document

## Usage

```
python triage.py [FOLDER]
```

## Ideas

* Use OCR to extract text from images and suggest metadata
* Move the documents to the corresponding archives folders
